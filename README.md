# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**NearMe** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: *10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search bar will filter to show businesses for which the search text is the PREFIX of any WORD in the business title (so, typing “h” won’t give you every result that has “thai” in the title or any other word with an h as the common range filter does, but you also aren’t limited to the “House of Thai” result or other businesses whose name has “h” as the first letter of the very first word - if you don’t trust your spelling of “Tamarind”, you can simply search “Hall” and get the “Tamarind Hall” you wanted).
- [x] Customize navigation bar (Yelp color, buttons)
- [x] Map view navigation bar button changes icon to a list view when in map mode, guiding users to click it again to return to viewing results as a list (table view)
- [x] Map view button icon made in house (no legal issues!  Made by me, in Sketch3)
- [x] List view icon made in house (no legal issues!  Made by me, in Sketch3)


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
